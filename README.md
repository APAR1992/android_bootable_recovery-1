### CyanogenMod Bootable Recovery directory
* This is clockwork based recovery with touch controls written by Napstar.
* The reboot wrappers have been specifically configured for use with the Kindle Fire (originally configured by DooMLoRD).

### Please note:
* While this is based off of the gingerbread branch it includes ICS commit 'Retouch Binaries' for 3.0 boot image compatibility; this requires that 'system/extras/ext4_utils' be replaced by the ICS version.
* The include line for system extras has been renamed to system/ics_extras for easier compat with the rom itself.
